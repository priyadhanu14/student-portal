# Student Portal

## Introduction

Student Portal provides a simple interface for the maintenance of student information that can be used by our college to maintain the records of students easily. <br/>Apart from storing the general information about a student, the student portal provides options for recording activities undertaken by the student such as internships, sports activities and so on. Different reports and queries can be generated based on vast options related to students, batch, course, faculty, exams, certification and even the entire college. <br/>
The design and implementation of a comprehensive Student Information Management System and the user interface replaces the current paper records and for more of an improvised approach to maintaining the records. User interfaces for Class Advisors, Head of the Departments and Officials are created separately and contain functionalities native to their position.

## Existing System

- In the existing system, student details are entered manually.
- Maintaining the student details in separate records is a tedious task. Referring to all these records and updating them is difficult. There is also a chance for more manual errors as the system is less user friendly and it requires a lot of manual work.
- A manual system does not mean that we are working with pen and paper only, it also means working on spreadsheets and other simple software.
- Working on such systems is time-consuming and also less secure and unable to generate different kinds of reports.

## Proposed System

- The main goal of the entire system is to provide a user-friendly interface and powerful data system which make this system more useful.
- The system reduces most of the human work that is done earlier to manage the college system.

## Objective

- To be able to view and monitor the performance of the students in all four pillars of the LICET
- To get insights of the overall performance of the students - class wise, department wise and at the institution level
- Automate the student information management system
